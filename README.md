# React Front-End challenge

## Challenge
Create a simple (no-login) dashboard that integrates two components in two different tabs:

1. A table component that fetches API REST information from a given endpoint
  
    a. We recommend CovalentHQ /transactions_v2/ endpoint (you will need an api key)

    b. The table should show the key endpoint properties such as: tx id, gas fee, timestamp, blocknumber, etc.

    c. The table should let the user sort the records by timestamp and blocknumber.


2. A chart component (like recharts) to show on different types (like pie and bars) to show stats also coming from APIs endpoint (we recommend snowtrace or covalent stats)

    a. The components should render on this new tab and show proper values coming from the endpoint.

    b. Any chart that reflects value based on the endpoint that it is recommended to tuse.

## Deliverable

- A React application along with the instructions to satisfy dependencies and run it.
- The application should be delivered by forking this repository, upload the code and create a PR for reviewing.

## Tools

Recommended tools:
- ReactJs
- Recharts
- MUI datatables
- Dockerfile / docker image is preferred.
